# MTN upgrade project
#### A project that tests the knowledge of pandas library in manipulation and data analysis
#### By **Edwin Mutuma**
## Description
This projectaimed at performing indepth analysis needed to come up with viable recommendations for MTN about how to go about their upgrade with the right insight.
The process starts off by loading the datasets into a notebook of choice,(In my case it was the colab notebook by Google), and creating dataframes from the dtasets provided.
From there, we cleaned the data which included dealing with null values, deleting duplicated values and renaming the columns that were misspelt. This would be a prerequisite for the later process of manipulation that involves merging the dataframes we were cleaning. 
If not cleaned, the merging process would bring about wrong insight.
After merging all the dataframes, analysis was carried out as needed to come up with the answers to our questions and in tandem with our objectives

## Technologies Used
Being a data science project, the project required data analysis and manipulation which was to be done by Python programming language using the Pandas Library. 

## Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist.
The goal of data is insight and if you find insight, do let me know.
